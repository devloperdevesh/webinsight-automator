## 📌 About the Project

**WebInsight Automator** is a production-ready, full-stack automation platform designed to **extract, process, and expose structured data from JavaScript-heavy websites**.

The project demonstrates **real-world backend engineering skills** including:

* Async API design
* Selenium-based web automation
* REST API development
* Cloud deployment
* Frontend-backend integration

This project is built with **interview and production readiness** in mind.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Most modern websites rely heavily on JavaScript rendering, making traditional scraping tools ineffective. Recruiters and companies often require:

* Automated data extraction
* Clean and structured output
* Reliable APIs for downstream use

**WebInsight Automator solves this by combining Selenium with FastAPI** to scrape dynamic websites and expose the results via secure REST APIs.

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

```
Frontend (React + Vite)
        ↓ Fetch API
FastAPI Backend (Async APIs)
        ↓
Selenium Web Scraper (Headless Chrome)
        ↓
Processed JSON Response
```

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Backend

* **Python 3.11**
* **FastAPI** (Async REST APIs)
* **Selenium** (JavaScript-heavy scraping)
* **Uvicorn** (ASGI server)

### Frontend

* **React (Vite)**
* **Fetch API**
* Clean dashboard-style UI (White, Gray, Blue theme)

### DevOps & Deployment

* **Render** – Backend hosting
* **Vercel** – Frontend hosting
* **Git & GitHub** – Version control

---

## 🔐 API Security

The backend uses **API-Key based authentication** to protect scraping endpoints.

Each request must include:

```
x-api-key: webinsight-secret-key
```

This approach is simple, secure, and interview-friendly.

---

## 📡 API Endpoints

### Health Check

```
GET /api/health
```

Response:

```json
{ "status": "OK" }
```

---

### Scrape Website

```
POST /api/scrape
```

Request Body:

```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "title": "Page Title"
  }
}
```

---

## 🖥️ Frontend Usage

1. Open the frontend URL
2. Enter any public website URL
3. Click **Scrape**
4. View extracted data in JSON format

The frontend communicates directly with the deployed backend on Render.
